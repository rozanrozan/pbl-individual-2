## Project Introduction

PBL (Project Based Learning) Individual is the final task of Data Analytics for Business bootcamp at Bitlabs Academy which is done individually. In this project, we help companies who want to reassess their budget allocation for payroll schemes. In this case, as a data analyst, I make a scoring of employees with a scale of 1-100 and make a decision on how many employees should be laid off based on the scoring so that this analysis is expected to be effective in spending the costs used to hire employees.

<br>

<strong> Objectives </strong>
<p> The objective/target of this project is:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Analyzing data using SQL </li>
  <li> Create visualizations/dashboards using Looker Studio </li>
</ul>

<br>

<strong> Datasets </strong>
<p> This data set is provided by recruitment partners. So, I'm not allowed to provide the dataset in full.</p>

## Analysis Result
<p> Here are some analysis results obtained from SQL processing: </p>
<ol>
  <li>The Total number of employees in this company is 137 employees.</li>
  <li>The Total number of branches owned by this company is 15 branches.</li>
  <li>The average length of working hours per month is 204.21 hours.</li>
  <li>Most employees receive a salary that is too high compared to the salary calculation should be.</li>
  <li>The first branch has the highest rate of working hours and also the largest total salary expenditure.</li>
  <li> A total of 48 employees had to be laid off because they did not meet the assessment standards set.</li>
</ol>

## Recommendations Given
<p> The following are recommendations that can be used by companies to effectively spend costs. </p>
<ol>
  <li>The company had to lay off 48 employees who did not have Assessment Standards.</li>
  <li>The company must make salary adjustments based on the calculation of the salary that should be paid.</li>
  <li>The company can prioritize the first branch to improve the performance of the company.</li>
  <li>The company must discipline employees for absenteeism.</li>
</ol>
